# MAP_APP
Client needed a way to be able te represent Catalonian business into a map so the main idea of the code is to create a .exe that ables the client to download a template with business information & adress or coordinates, upload info and select colour, size & map background. 
the map is visualized by the user so they can check if it's ok, if there's any error in DATA, user gets notified and option to download .xlsx with errors appears in main root.
